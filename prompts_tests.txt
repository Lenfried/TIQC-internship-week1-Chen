Initial Prompt:
build a CLI tool to parse a .csv of: 
column 1: student names
column 2: GPA
and calculates the average GPA of all students and outputs it, rounded to 2 decimal places.
also output the number of rows processed

ask the user to put the .csv in the same directory as the program and enter the file name of the .csv
skip the first row if the first value is "Student Name"
ignore any rows if the GPA value is not a number, or if any values in the row are blank

Post-prompt:
Added "Name" as an additional string to ignore if it's in the first row.
Added an if statement to skip the line if the GPA value is over 4.0 or is negative.
